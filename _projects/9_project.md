title: Regression Models
description: Developed as part of the Computer Graphics Theory and Application (GCT522) course, this Unity3D project explores procedural generation and shader-based weather effects to create a dynamic and immersive environment. The terrain is procedurally populated with rivers, trees, and plants, while the player spawns at a random location and must navigate the landscape to find a camp. Realistic weather effects, including wind, rain, and lightning, enhance both the visual atmosphere and gameplay challenge. Inspired by Valheimâ€™s aesthetic, the project emphasizes dramatic night weather, adding depth and intensity to the experience.
