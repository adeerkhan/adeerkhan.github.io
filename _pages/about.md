I am an asset integrity engineer with a strong focus on computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I work at [Softoo Pvt](https://softoo.co) Ltd in collaboration with [Abyss Solutions](https://abysssolutions.co), where I am passionate about leveraging advanced technologies to develop intelligent management solutions. My educational background includes a degree in civil engineering from [Capital University of Science and Technology](https://cust.edu.pk) in Islamabad. 

Combining my interdisciplinary background, I aim to blend Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with geoinformatics for innovative infrastructure management. Envisioning data-driven urban planning that tackles sprawl and sustainability challenges, I intend to create a framework that optimizes both infrastructure and community well-being. With a strong foundation in civil engineering, a commitment to continuous learning, and a passion for innovation, I'm poised to contribute significantly to this dynamic field.
