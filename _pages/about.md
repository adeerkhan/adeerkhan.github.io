I am a master student at [KAIST, South Korea](https://cee.kaist.ac.kr), studying civil and environmental engineering, working at [Smart and Sustainable Environment Design Laboratory KAIST](https://ssel.kaist.ac.kr). My research focus is on sustainable urban design. I am passionate about leveraging advanced technologies to develop intelligent management solutions. My educational background includes a degree in civil engineering from [Capital University of Science and Technology](https://cust.edu.pk) in Islamabad.

Leveraging my interdisciplinary background, I aspire to seamlessly integrate Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with geoinformatics to revolutionize infrastructure management. I envision practical solutions  that tackle sustainability challenges, optimizing both infrastructure and community well-being. With a strong civil engineering foundation, a commitment to learning, and a passion for innovation, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact.
