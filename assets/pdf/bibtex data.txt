abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an advanced tool that revolutionizes the capability of a structure to act as a responsive system â€“ detecting changes and responding with performance analysis. But, for developing countries, its need is undermined due to its costly deployment. However, contrary to the costly belief, its use is direly needed in densely populated developing countries. Therefore, a simple and cheaper technique (despite lesser precision and accuracy) can help in the early detection of damages in structures. Unfortunately, SHM implementation has been inadequate in developing countries, consequently, limited literature is available to assess. Therefore, the main goal of this literature review is to identify and analyze various SHM approaches and then propose a simple yet effective approach for achieving the basic amenities of SHM. By analyzing previous highly reputable journals, it was deduced that vibration-based approaches are the most cost-effective and simplistic to implement, which have resurged recently due to the increased use of computational tools that minimize extraneous data and provide efficient noise removal. The use of combination techniques in SHM can be cost-effective and accessible for developing nations, providing solutions for infrastructure sustainability.}

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an advanced tool that revolutionizes the capability of a structure to act as a responsive system by detecting changes and responding with performance analysis. But, for developing countries, its need is undermined due to its costly deployment. However, contrary to the costly belief, its use is direly needed in densely populated developing countries. Therefore, a simple and cheaper technique (despite lesser precision and accuracy) can help in the early detection of damages in structures. This can lead to avoiding financial and human loss. The primary objective of the project is to analyze the gaps in the application of SHM in developing countries and then recommend and achieve a simple approach to achieve its amenities through experimental and numerical validation. A critical review is made keeping in mind the previous research and the high-end deployed SHM on various structures across the developing countries. The advanced and simple approaches for SHM with their basic principles are thoughtfully analyzed. Then a prototype structure is prepared with induced cracking damage stages in columns and two cases based stiffness provided at joints. Snapback and harmonic tests are performed for both phenomena to assess the structural responses. A snapback test was performed to assess the natural frequencies and the damping ratios of the system. Whereas, the harmonic test was performed on the structure using a locally made shake table that was varied with increasing frequency and specific loading amplitude. The results were tabulated into acceleration-time and displacement-time histories which were initially used to assess the structural response. They were used to compute base shear and energy dissipation in the structure. Both methods produced reliable results. It was analyzed that the adopted strategy in the project is a viable and simpler approach to utilize on real-time structures. The instrumentation deployment is cheap and easy to handle. A combination of two approaches leads to better correlation results for the structure. Due to the increase in computational power, and the ability to handle large data through machine learning algorithms. An automated system can be devised that would detect the sudden changes in energy dissipation and time histories. It would then generate a warning through an automated smartphone system. This would allow better implementation of SHM in developing countries.}
